# ADVOCadO

ADVOCadO, a silly name variation by me for **ADV**ent **O**f **CO**de (which
doesn't even make sense not that I think of it). üéÑ Be merry üéÑ and EAT LOTS OF
CHOCOLATE

This has become a Prolog mainly challenge (and a procrastination tool for my
PhD). The current pattern is: I RIOT and drop Prolog the moment any sort of 2D
array crap comes in ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø To solve this issue, from 2022, I have
[pyvent-of-code](https://github.com/kittykg/pyvent-of-code) where I code in
python, and maybe for once in forever, I'll manage to finish a full year of AoC.

### Notes & TODOs

**2024**:

- Finally committed and learned DCG (POG)

- Day 6 part 2 takes 2.5 hrs to run lol

- Day 7 takes in total 14.8 s to run (compared to combinatorial python's 19.1s
  POG)

- Day 9 not happening. I did too much mutation in python, don't think it will
  translate well in Prolog ü•≤

**2023**:

- Another year, another AoC prolog attempt UwU

- Day 3 not happening

- Day 5 part 2 not working ü•≤

**2022**:

- Survive ü•≤

- Day 11, 12, 14, 16 (although they are all done in python)

- NOT DO DAY 17

**2021**:

- Finish it (hopium)

**2020**:

- Finish it (hopium)

- Use `clpfd` to handle numbers (Can't bother tbh, 2021 onwards should be using
  `clpfd` all the time)

- Rewrite Day 16 in Prolog with DCG

## Languages

- SWI-Prolog

- Python

  - Some pre-parse in python in [pyvent-of-code](https://github.com/kittykg/pyvent-of-code)

  - Need to rewrite 2020 Day 16 part 2

  - 2022 / 2023 my lazy ass doing python first and try to finish AoC for once
    _maybe_. Check my
    [pyvent-of-code](https://github.com/kittykg/pyvent-of-code) for status and
    solutions.

## Last but not least, my memes

I'm a noob ü§°. So I make memes about my sadge Prolog AoC experience and post it
on [r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) because why not?

[2023 Day 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189rk3u/2023_day_3prolog_bye_guys_see_you_next_year/) - Yeah...ü´†

[2022 Day 16](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/znjzjm/2022_day_16_if_a_solution_gives_me_a_star_then/) - My cheat python solution

[2020 Day 15](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kdkn37/2020_day_15_part_2_im_still_waiting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - GIT GUD USE TRIE
