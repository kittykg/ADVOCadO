# ADVOCadO

ADVOCadO, a silly name variation by me for **ADV**ent **O**f **CO**de. Be merry and don't eat chocolate (but I do approve a good panettone)

This has become a Prolog mainly challenge (and a procrastination tool atm for my PhD). The current pattern is: I RIOT and drop Prolog the moment any sort of 2D array crap comes in Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯ To solve this issue, from 2022, I have [pyvent-of-code](https://github.com/kittykg/pyvent-of-code) which I everything in python, and maybe, for once in forever, I'll manage to finish a full year of AoC.

## Languages

- SWI-Prolog

- Python

    - Need to rewrite 2020 Day 16 part 2

    - 2022 my lazy ass doing python first and try to finish AoC for once *maybe*. Check my [pyvent-of-code](https://github.com/kittykg/pyvent-of-code) for status and solutions.

## Some TODOs

For 2022: Survive ðŸ¥²

For 2021:

- Finish it

For 2020:

- Finish it

- Use `clpfd` to handle numbers (Can't bother tbh, 2021 onwards should be using `clpfd` all the time)

- Rewrite Day 16 in Prolog with DCG

## Last but not least, my memes

I'm a noob ðŸ¤¡. So I make memes about my sadge Prolog AoC experience and post it on [r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) because why not?

[2022 Day 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/z9qh64/2022_day_1prolog_spent_30min_figuring_out_how_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - My `helper.pl` broke probably because of the blank line

[2020 Day 15](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kdkn37/2020_day_15_part_2_im_still_waiting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - GIT GUD USE TRIE
