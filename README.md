# ADVOCadO

ADVOCadO, a silly name variation by me for **ADV**ent **O**f **CO**de. Be merry
and EAT LOTS OF CHOCOLATE

This has become a Prolog mainly challenge (and a procrastination tool atm for my
PhD). The current pattern is: I RIOT and drop Prolog the moment any sort of 2D
array crap comes in Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯ To solve this issue, from 2022, I have
[pyvent-of-code](https://github.com/kittykg/pyvent-of-code) where I code in
python, and maybe for once in forever, I'll manage to finish a full year of AoC.

## Status

**2023**: 9.5 / 25

**2022**: 12 / 25

**2020**: 16 / 25

## Languages

- SWI-Prolog

- Python
    - Some pre-parse in python in [pyvent-of-code](https://github.com/kittykg/pyvent-of-code)

    - Need to rewrite 2020 Day 16 part 2

    - 2022 / 2023 my lazy ass doing python first and try to finish AoC for once
    *maybe*. Check my [pyvent-of-code](https://github.com/kittykg/pyvent-of-code)
    for status and solutions.

## Some TODOs

For 2023:

- Another year, another AoC prolog attempt UwU

- Day 3 not happening

- Day 5 part 2 not working ðŸ¥²

For 2022:

- Survive ðŸ¥²

- Day 11, 12, 14, 16 (although they are all done in python)

- NOT DO DAY 17

For 2021:

- Finish it (hopium)

For 2020:

- Finish it (hopium)

- Use `clpfd` to handle numbers (Can't bother tbh, 2021 onwards should be using
`clpfd` all the time)

- Rewrite Day 16 in Prolog with DCG

## Last but not least, my memes

I'm a noob ðŸ¤¡. So I make memes about my sadge Prolog AoC experience and post it
on [r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) because why not?

[2023 Day 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189rk3u/2023_day_3prolog_bye_guys_see_you_next_year/) - Yeah...ðŸ« 

[2022 Day 16](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/znjzjm/2022_day_16_if_a_solution_gives_me_a_star_then/) - My cheat python solution
