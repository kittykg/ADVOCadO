Be merry and eat chocolate!

Don't know what languages I'll use but Prolog is one of them for sure :D

(Or maybe prolog will be the only language I'll use???)

## Languages

- SWI-Prolog

- Python (Just for now! I'm gonna rewrite 2020 Day 16 part 2)

## Some TODOs

- Rewrite Day 16 in Prolog with DCG
